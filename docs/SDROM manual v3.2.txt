SDROM v3.2 MANUAL

The SDROM is a utility ROM for managing disk images on a SD-card. The disk 
images can be accessed by the standard Atom DOS commands. The SDROM consists 
of 2 parts:

1) SD-card disk-image handling commands
2) Atom DOS compatible commands. 

The SDROM is started by typing SDDOS on the command line.
A list of the commands can be displayed by entering *DHELP on the command line.

Parameters:

  <drv>	Drive number (0 to 3)
  <dnf>	Disk Name Filter specification, i.e. first letter of disk name

Parameters in brackets are optional.
Note: If disk titles contain spaces they must be enclosed in quotes.

GENERAL COMMANDS:

  SDDOS

Enters the SD-card Operating System.

  *DOS

Enters the standard Atom Disk Operating System.

  *COS

Enters the standard Atom 300 baud Cassette Operating System

COMMANDS TO HANDLE DISK-IMAGES ON SD-CARD:

  *DIN <drv>,”<filename>”

Mounts a diskimagefile on SD-card into drive.
Example: *DIN 0,”DEMO.DSK”

Note: A disk cannot be in more than one drive at a time. E.g. if Disk 200 is 
in Drive 0, and the user enters *DIN 2,200, Disk 200 will then be in Drive 2, 
and “No Disk” will be in Drive 0.


  *DOUT <drv>
	
	Removes a diskimage from the disklist

  *DCAT (<dnf>)

List *.DSK image files on SD-carder order.
An optional Disk Name Filter can be specified.
Example: *DCAT G displays all disk images starting with “G”:

GAMES1.DSK
GAMES2.DSK
GAMES3.DSK

DISKS FOUND:    3

The number of disks found matching the specification is given at the bottom of the list.

  *DDISKS

Lists the drives and which disk images are currently “inserted”.
Example: *DDISKS

0: GAMES1.DSK
1: DATABASE.DSK
2:    -
3:    -

  *DHELP

Display list with *-commands to handle disk-images on SD-card

  *DVER

Displays the AtoMMC firmware and bootloader versions


ATOM DOS COMMANDS:

  *CAT <drv>

Displays the catalogue. The first line shows the title of the disc and the 
current qualifier. The filenames are displayed arranged by qualifier, with '#' 
indicating that the file is locked. The catalogue is read when there was a 
disk change, otherwise it is transferred from the catalogue buffer (at #2000).

  *DELETE <filename>

Deletes the named file.

  *DIR <drv>

Reads the catalogue from disc to the buffer but does not display it.

  *DRIVE <drv>

Sets drive number without loading the catalogue

  *INFALL

Displays information about all files on disk. The format is the same as *INFO 


  *INFO <filename>

Displays information about the named file. The format is: 

	qualifier lock  filename load    execution length   start
	          state          address address   in bytes sector

     s:          #   BASIC    C000    C2B2      00100     002

  *LOAD <filename> <loadaddress>

Loads the named file. The file is loaded into memory starting at <loadaddress>,
or at the file's start address if this is missing.

  *LOCK <filename>

Locks the named file. Locked files cannot be deleted or updated.

  *MON

Turns on messages. Subsequent file operations print out the file's information 
in the format of *INFO.

  *NOMON

Turns off messages

  *RUN <filename> <string>

Load and run the named file, using the start and execution address. <string> is
transferred to memory starting at #0140 with a terminating CR, where it can be 
accessed by the user's program.

  *SAVE <filename> <startaddress> <endaddress> <linkaddress>

Creates a file. The contents of memory from <startaddress> to <endaddress>-1 
are saved as the named file. If a file with the same name already exists under
the current qualifier, it is deleted. The address <linkaddress> is an optional 
execution address and it defaults to <startaddress> if not supplied.

  *SET<qual>

Sets the qualifier for all subsequent operations on files to <qual>. Operations
that use existing files will only search among those created under the 
qualifier currently set. The default qualifier is space. When returning to the
default qualifier, be sure to enter the space after the SET command.

  *TITLE <txt>

Sets the title of the disc to the first 13 characters of title.

  *UNLOCK <filename>

Unlocks the named file 

  *USE<qual>

Temporarily sets the qualifier to <qual>. The system returns to the previous 
qualifier after the next successful operation. Two successive USE commands are 
equivalent to a SET.

  *<filename> <string>

Load and run the named file, using the start and execution address. <string>
is transferred to memory starting at #0100 with a terminating CR, where it can
be accessed by the user's program.
